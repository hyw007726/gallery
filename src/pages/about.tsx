      <p>Try out OpenAI&apos;s DALLÂ·E model, which generates images based on text input! You can login, comment, upload, and let your imagination run wild. Give it a try and see what kind of images you can create!</p>
      <p>The frontend is built with TypeScript and React/Next.js with a few server-side rendering features using server&apos;s Node environment.</p>
      <p>For the UI and UX, I used many Ant Design components besides Next.js&apos;s built-in component. For the styling, I used the built-in CSS Modules.</p>
      <p>The backend is built with Java and Spring Boot. There are four layers: controller, repository, entity and service. The app is deployed on an AliCloud server. The database is MySQL.</p>
       <p>There are basically three entities or data models: Users, Images and Comments. I used JPA to map the object with the tables in backend, and created TypeScript types for the three models in frontend.</p>
       <p>For authentication,  the GitHub login is done with OAuth, but the email sign-up and login section is developed independently with Java&apos;s Thymeleaf template. Google&apos;s auth is okay in local environment but it requires domain name in production.</p>
      <p>User&apos;s password will be encrypted first before being saved in database. If you login with a GitHub account for the first time, you&apos;ll receive an email with a code for tradional login, so you won&apos;t have duplicate accounts with the same email address.</p>
      <p>For user&apos;s input sanitization, I set a list of keywords such as eval to avoid cross-site scripting attacks. Spring Boot&apos;s JPA also defends against SQL injection by default.</p>
